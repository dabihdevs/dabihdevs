### Hello, World! 👋 My name is Dabih Isidori
#### atmospheric scientist, developer and graphic designer

I achieved a Master's degree in Atmospheric Sciences at the university of Innsbruck (Austria): there I started learning about Python programming, data analysis and data visualization. After graduating, I started further honing my Python skills as well as my knowledge about informatics in general. I currently teach Python and work on a freelance ESP32 display board project using C/C++. 


#### Skills:
- 🐍 PYTHON (data analysis and visualization, machine learning models, software development)
- 👨‍💻 C/C++ (microprocessors programming using Arduino framework and PlatformIO)
- 🎮 C# (games development, websites back-end)
- 🌍 HTML/CSS (websites front-end)
- 💻 GUI (Squareline Studio, LVGL graphic library)
- 🖌 GRAPHIC DESIGN (Inkscape, Krita, Gimp, Canva.com)

#### About me now:
- 👨‍🏫 I'm currently giving Python lectures, tailoring my courses on the needs of my students. Recently I have been creating a full Python course using Jupyter Notebooks.
- ⚡ I'm also working freelance on the software of a ESP32 display board. The display is needed to interact with a welding machine. I'm creating both GUI and program logic of the software.
- 🎓 Beside that, I'm constantly honing my C/C++ and C# knowledge and skills.
- ☂ Fun fact 1: I worked as a meteorologist in the past and I've recently joined Pretemp, an Italian association of weather forecasters particularly interested in any kind of Thunderstorms.
- 🎤 Fun fact 2: I'm very interested in storytelling, teaching, presenting and communication in general.
