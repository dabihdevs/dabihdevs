### Hello, World! 👋 My name is Dabih Isidori
#### data analyst, software developer and graphic designer

I achieved a **Master's degree in Atmospheric Sciences** at the university of Innsbruck (Austria), where I started learning about **Python programming, data analysis and data visualization**. After graduating, I further honed my Python skills as well as my knowledge about Computer Sciences in general.

I worked a lot with the **geospatial data and time series**, also in complex data formats like netCDF, using ```pandas``` and ```xarray```. I also realized different **data visualization projects** using Python libraries like ```matplotlib```, ```seaborn``` and ```plotly```, as well as graphic design softwares. I also know how to create **SQL queries** to pick data of interest from large databases.

I also worked with **embedded C/C++** and **Arduino Framework** to develop the firmware of a LCD display microprocessor. The display serves as the user interface of a wielding machine. I created both GUI and program logic, working with data packets transmitted through UART connections.


#### Skills:
- 🐍 PYTHON (data analysis and visualization, machine learning models, software development)
- 👨‍💻 C/C++ (developing microprocessors firmwares using Arduino framework and PlatformIO)
- 🎮 C# (games development)
- 🌍 HTML/CSS (websites front-end)
- 💻 GUI DEVELOPMENT (Squareline Studio, LVGL graphic library)
- 🖌 GRAPHIC DESIGN (Inkscape, Krita, Gimp, Canva.com)

#### About me now:
- 👨‍🏫 I'm currently a Python and data analysis tutor. Recently I have been creating a full Python course using Jupyter Notebooks.
- ⚡ I'm also working on the firmware of a ESP32 display board. The display is needed to interact with a welding machine. I'm creating both GUI and program logic.
- 🎓 Beside that, I'm constantly honing my Computer Science knowledge and skills.

 #### Fun facts:
 - 🐉 In my free time I'm a **Game and Narrative Designer**. I design and write TTRPG adventures, worldbuilding and creating characters, game maps and items.
   🎮 I realized a simple RPG game using ```pygame```, and I also played around with the Godot Engine, programming in C#. **One day I would really like to join a videogame project!**
