### Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dabih Isidori, I'm an atmospheric scientist, a designer and a Python developer. I achieved a Master's degree in Atmospheric Sciences at the university of Innsbruck (Austria): there I started learning about Python programming, data analysis and data visualization. After graduating, I started further honing my Python skills as well as my knowledge about informatics in general.
